How is the web different from the internet?  I would describe the internet as the network that connects anyone anywhere on earth.  It is like a big structure that connects us to each other. The web is the information we can find, use and add to on the internet.
The internet is a connecting structure.  I have an ISO address which identifies my computer or access tool to go onto the internet.  I may want to send something from my computer to my work, for example.  That document is turned itno a packet which travels through routers so quickly we dont even realize it has to travel through multiple routers before it hits my employers IP and their computer where he or she can view, edit and send it along to anotehr person or back to me for editing it or even filing it away.
A directory is where you would keep your files on your computer,  I might have a number of directories to help organize where my files are in a way that is productive.  I hope this is what you are askign rather than somehtign related to web design :)
My understanding if the benefits of using a VCS is that you can go back and look at prior versions of a file in order to see what changed or which version you actually may need.
